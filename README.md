# All about an unremarkable me
If you're expecting some grand statement, you've come to a weird place to get one. I'm just a verified human person who occasionally takes time out of journaling to write code for something. I'm somewhat skilled in HTML and CSS, marginally better than some hamsters at Photoshop and Lightroom, and occasionally pick up a camera to take blurry photos of my knees on accident.

## I journal and take notes like, a *lot*
It's true, you're looking at my commits and thinking, damn, this person writes a *lot* of code. But, in fact, most of that is really just me taking notes on everything because I am very forgetful and not currently medicated.
